# ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
Piggy Boss Finance App is a personal finance management system developed as a study project for a university course at UERJ. The backend is powered by Django and Django REST Framework (DRF), while the frontend is built using React, providing users with a modern and intuitive interface.

The system features a login and registration flow to ensure secure user access.


Once registered, users can manage their finances by:

- Registering income and expense transactions,
- Creating and managing cards, banks, and spending categories.

All this information is available through the user dashboard, which presents a basic overview of financial history with charts and summaries.
In the Transactions section, users can view and add their financial records through a interface.

# ðŸš§ Features in Development
- Advanced filters for viewing historical purchases by date, category, card, and bank.
- Financial planning and budgeting tools, with data transformation and aggregation based on user-defined criteria (e.g., by card, bank, or category).


This project aims to learn and apply real practices of REST API, database modeling, and frontend-backend integration designs.

# Future Improvements
This was the initial phase of the project to deliver the assignment for the UERJ course. From this point on, the project will be revamped aiming at current React design patterns and a restructuring for better code understanding and modularity, as well as the delivery of new features.

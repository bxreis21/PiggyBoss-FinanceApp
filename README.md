ðŸ“Œ Project Overview (EN)
Piggy Boss Finance App is a personal finance management system developed as a study project for a university course at UERJ. The backend is powered by Django and Django REST Framework (DRF), while the frontend is built using React, providing users with a modern and intuitive interface.

The system features a login and registration flow to ensure secure user access.


Once registered, users can manage their finances by:

- Registering income and expense transactions,
- Creating and managing cards, banks, and spending categories.

All this information is available through the user dashboard, which presents a basic overview of financial history with charts and summaries.
In the Transactions section, users can view and add their financial records through a interface.

ðŸš§ Features in Development
- Advanced filters for viewing historical purchases by date, category, card, and bank.
- Financial planning and budgeting tools, with data transformation and aggregation based on user-defined criteria (e.g., by card, bank, or category).


This project aims to learn and apply real practices of REST API, database modeling, and frontend-backend integration designs.
